<s> Jodo Shinshu ( Shin-Buddhism / True Pure Land Sect ) is one of the sects of Japanese Buddhism , and a religious community that Shinran , an apprentice of Honen , succeeded and which developed Honen 's doctrine ( Jodo Shu / Pure Land Buddhism ) in the early Kamakura period . </s>
<s> Due to the historical background of the origin of the sect name , most sects belonging to this religion call themselves Shinshu as a sect name . </s>
<s> It used to also be called Ikko Shu and Monto Shu . </s>
<s> Doctrine </s>
<s> By saying a prayer ( Shomyo nenbutsu ) to the Buddha ( Namu Amida Butsu , Namo Amida Butsu by Hongan-ji School ) , practitioners can believe in the mercy of Amida Nyorai ( hereinafter called " Nyorai " ) , and trust in Tariki ( Buddha 's power ) , which makes everyone , including the bad , go to Jodo ( Pure Land ) after death and become Buddha . </s>
<s> Through this , the doctrine of Shinshu is called " Shinjin Shoin , Shomyo Ho-on " ( Faith makes it happen , and praying is for gratitude ) . </s>
<s> Rennyo , the 8th head-priest of Hongan-ji Temple , stated in " Ofumi " as follows . </s>
<s> " First of all , the policy of Kaisan Sho 'nin ( Shinran ) gives faith first priority . </s>
<s> What use is faith us , shameless unenlightened men , who do wrong without good deed , to easily go to Jodo of Mida ( Amida ) . </s>
<s> Without acquiring this faith , no one could go to paradise and avoid falling to Muken Jigoku ( Avici Hell ) . </s>
<s> Regarding " Shomyo Ho-on , " he mentioned " On that basis , we should be aware that Shomyo nenbutsu is Buddhist invocation to appreciate the kindness ( Go-on Hojin ) that Nyorai decided that we could go to Heaven . " ( ib. book5 , chapter10 ) , which means that Shomyo nenbutsu in Jodo Shinshu are words of gratitude for Nyorai 's salvation . </s>
<s> This is based on Forty-eight Vows of " Infinite Life Sutra ( Bussetsu Muryojukyo ) " , especially the Eighteenth Vow ( Senjaku Hongan ) called " O 'Hongan ) . </s>
<s> The principal image ( Honzon ) is only Amida Nyorai . </s>
<s> However , Takada School and a part of the sect have Amida Nyorai , Kanzeon Bosatsu and Seishi Bosatsu as their principal images , in Zenko-ji Amida Sanson style . </s>
<s> Generally , the idea that " the vow of Amida Nyorai is offered to us even at this moment and we are saved " ( Gensho shojoju ) was misunderstood by a number of people , and repeatedly corrected . </s>
<s> Rennyo mentioned in " Ofumi ( Gobunsho ) " ; </s>
<s> " Not forgetting the kindness of Mida , who decided that we could go to Heaven long time ago , when achieving enlightenment is what faith is about . </s>
<s> This is a big misconception . </s>
<s> Even though we know the story of Mida Nyorai 's achieving enlightenment , it does not mean anything if we do not know the story of faith in Tariki that we can go to Heaven . " </s>
<s> He explained here that knowing how Nyorai became Buddha is merely knowledge , and it is important to know the origin of faith in Tariki given by Nyorai ( faith in truth ) . </s>
<s> He confirmed Shinjin Shoin here and defined correctly , and never mentioned " Reciting nenbutsu simply takes everyone to paradise " . </s>
<s> In Jodo Shinshu , faith given by Nyorai helps people . </s>
<s> Nenbutsu is definitely recited for gratitude , not the condition of going to Heaven . </s>
<s> Shinran also mentioned " What gets you to Nehan ( Nirvana ) is only faith " in " Kyogo shinsho " , and " Regard that true faith gets you to Anoku bodai ( ultimate enlightenment ) " in " Songo shinzo meimon " . </s>
<s> What makes Shinshu greatly different from other Buddhist sects is that monks have no commandments and are allowed to eat meat and to get married ( Nikujiki-Saitai ) . ( Shinshu was the only sect that allowed monks to get married until the Meiji period . ) </s>
<s> Originally , Shinran learned that helping those who cannot help but stray from the concept of a general monk ( who enters the priesthood and practices asceticism , renouncing the world ) and the norm of Buddhists ( laity ) living in the world is Hongan Nenbutsu ( praying for the vows ) from his master Honen , and became the first monk to openly get married and have a child . </s>
<s> Therefore , Shinshu has two lineages , which are Homyaku ( master -apprentice relationship ) and Kechimyaku ( blood relationship ) . </s>
<s> And the given name is called Homyo instead of Kaimyo . </s>
<s> With its doctrine that everyone can go to Heaven ( Ojo jobutsu ) only by trusting Nyorai 's power ( in other words , if acquiring true faith ) , Shinshu , compared to other sects , is free from many religious exercises and customs , and makes much of nenbutsu and Mombo ( learning the teachings of Buddha ) for Ho-on Shatoku ( gratitude for kindness and virtue ) . </s>
<s> It is the only Buddhist sect that doesn 't perform Kaji kito ( incantation ) , which is another major feature of Shinshu . </s>
<s> Since it values rationality and has simple manners and teachings , it was widely accepted among the public in early modern ages , but on the other hand , it provoked antipathy from other sects and often got ridicule such as " Monto ( Shinshu followers ) know nothing " . </s>
<s> Shinshu also encouraged each household to enshrine its Honzon ( Myogo Honzon of " Namu Amida Butsu " , or a picture or statue of Amida Nyorai ) . </s>
<s> The " rules " on Shogon ( decoration ) of the Buddhist altar for enshrinement are more strict than other sects . </s>
<s> Shogon imitates Honzan ( the head temple ) , which makes each sect of Shinshu have different style and different ritual articles . </s>
<s> A Honzon enshrined and decorated in the Buddhist altar is called " Onaibutsu " in Shinshu . </s>
<s> Shinshu doesn 't use this as a family altar or prayer altar . </s>
<s> The Honzan of each Shinshu sect basically has a Goei-do hall to enshrine a portrait of Shinran , the founder , as well as a main hall ( Amida-do hall ) to enshrine Amida Nyorai , the Honzon . </s>
<s> Additionally , the architecture of Shinshu temples has unique features rarely seen in other sects , such as wider Gejin ( nave ) compared to Naijin ( chancel ) . </s>
<s> Each sect holds a memorial service called " Ho-onko " on the anniversary of the death of the founder Shinran Sho 'nin . </s>
<s> This memorial service is held to give thanks for the blessing of Gudo and Gukyo ( seeking and promoting the teachings ) , and the blessing of Amida Nyorai acquired through them , and to recognize the teachings . </s>
<s> This is the biggest event in a year . </s>
<s> However , the day of the memorial service depends on each sect of Shinshu . </s>
<s> ( See the schedule of Goshoki Ho-onko by sect for details . ) </s>
<s> The legitimate scriptures are Jodo sanbukyo ( Three Pure Land sutras ) . </s>
<s> The works of Shichi Koso ( seven high priests ) are also highly respected , although they are not scriptures . </s>
<s> " Muryojukyo Ubadaisha Ganshoge " by Tenjin was especially esteemed along with Jodo sanbukyo by his master Honen , who called these " Sankyo Ichiron " ( three sutras and one book ) . </s>
<s> Shinran especially esteemed " Bussetsu Muryojukyo " and called it " Daimuryojukyo " or " Daikyo " . </s>

<s> The founder Shinran took the lineage of Tariki Nenbutsu to Shakamuni and Shichi Koso into consideration , and devoted himself to succeed " the teachings of Jodo Shu as the true religion " and to enhance it , through his life after he regarded Honen ( the founder of Jodo Shu ) as his master . </s>
<s> Different interpretations of Hongan and Nenbutsu by the apprentices after Honen 's death made Seizan and other Schools of Jodo Shu criticize Shinran . </s>
<s> Shinran mentioned that " My master Genku ( Honen ) appeared by Chie ko ( the power of Amida Nyorai ) , started Jodo Shinshu and stated Senjaku Hongan " in " Koso Wasan " written during his life , which shows he thought that Jodo Shinshu consisted of the teachings of Jodo Shinshu started by Honen and carried on by himself . </s>
<s> Whereas , Rennyo 's thoughts were ; </s>
<s> " Soshi Sho 'nin ( Shinran ) already established Jodo Shinshu - it has superior significance to Jodo Shu and he added the letter Shin ( True ) and named it Jodo Shinshu . " </s>
<s> This shows that the view of the name of Jodo Shinshu , has changed with the times . </s>
<s> Since Shinran ( Jogen no Honan ) , engaged in his missionary work mainly in the Kanto region ; after deportation to Echigo , Monto followers who got the teachings of Shinran built up in Kanto region . </s>
<s> After Shinran died , it was formed as an independent religion from Jodo Shu . </s>
<s> Though the successors of the teachings of Shinran had the feeling that their own doctrine was the true teaching for going to Jodo , they named themselves just Shinshu at that time because naming themselves Jodo Shinshu could be interpreted as denial of Jodo Shu . </s>
<s> In fact , Jodo Shu and Ji Shu also called themselves " Jodo Shinshu " or " Shinshu " once , and Kyu Ikko-ha of Ji Shu ( the founder : Shunsho IKKO ) was called " Ikko Shu " once . </s>
<s> In the early modern era , the Edo Shogunate prohibited them from naming themselves " Jodo Shinshu " under pressure from Jodo Shu , which made them call themselves " Ikko Shu " officially ( on the other hand , the lineage of Shunsho Ikko which originally called themselves " Ikko Shu " was forced to be integrated into Ji Shu which was originally unrelated ) . </s>
<s> The conflict between Jodo Shinshu and Jodo Shu over the question whether or not the Shinran lineages could name themselves " Jodo Shinshu " was called Shumei Ronso , which lasted for 15 years from 1774 . </s>
<s> In 1872 , Dajokan Seiin issued an edict to each prefecture , saying " The name of Ikko Shu can be changed to Shinshu , " and finally here in the modern ages , describing it as " ( Jodo ) Shinshu " was allowed . </s>
<s> History </s>
<s> The Days of Shinran </s>
<s> After Shinran died , his great-grandson Kakunyo ( 1270-1351 ) alleged the legitimacy of succession of Shinran 's grave on the grounds of Sandai-denji ( Tradition of three generation ) and so on , and built Hongan-ji Temple ( also known as Otani Hongan-ji Temple ) and called himself the third head-priest of Hongan-ji Temple . </s>
<s> Against his movement , Ryogen ( 1295-1336 ) , the seventh head-priest of Bukko-ji Temple , who succeeded the lineage of Shinran 's disciples in Kanto region , and other Homyaku gradually took an opposing stance against Hongan-ji Temple , having Bukko-ji Temple and Senju-ji Temple as their bases . </s>
<s> Jodo Shinshu in those days had active missionary work in Bukko-ji Temple and Senju-ji Temple and acquired a number of followers , but Hongan-ji Temple just existed as a branch temple of Tendai Shu before the 8th head-priest Rennyo . </s>
<s> From emergence of Rennyo to Ishiyama Hongan-ji War </s>
<s> Rennyo ( 1415-1499 ) , the 8th head-priest of Hongan-ji Temple , who emerged in the late Muromachi period , established an organization called Kou against the backdrop of the growth of the public at the time , provided the opportunity for people to learn the teachings equally and to come together , and wrote " Ofumi ( Gobunsho ) " explaining the teachings of Shinran in plain words and disseminated it widely to the public . </s>
<s> By his achievement , Hongan-ji Temple rapidly developed and expanded , and came to be called Ikko Shu . ( On the contrary , other sects of Shinshu went into decline . ) </s>
<s> The strength of the group of followers in this Kou was directed at politicians ( such as Daimyo ) , despite Rennyo 's restraint . </s>
<s> Kokujin ( village heads ) and Dogo ( powerful families ) converted to Shinshu and joined the village people who were discontent with the system with complicated and multiple lordship in the end of the middle ages , and uprising called " Ikko-Ikki " were staged throughout the nation by united Ikko Shu followers from the whole county or province . </s>
<s> This led to frequent rebellions against Daimyo throughout the nation , such as the one in Kaga described below , and numbers of Daimyo , including Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Kenshin UESUGI , issued the anti-Ikkoshu edicts ( Kinkyorei ) . </s>
<s> The Shimazu clan in Satsuma Province particularly continued the Kinkyorei until the Meiji period , which made Shinshu followers organize Kou and observe their faith secretly in a cave in the mountains . ( Kakure Nenbutsu / Secret faith ) </s>
<s> Later , when the Onin War ( 1467-1477 ) broke out and an internal conflict occurred between East and West squads in Kaga Province , north of Yoshizaki Gobo , as the base of Hongan-ji Temple at that time in Echizen Province , the Monto of Senshu-ji School took the side of Kochiyo TOGASHI who took part in the West squad , while the Monto of Honganji School , through the assistance of Takakage ASAKURA , the Daimyo of Echizen ( the 7th chief ) , took the side of Masachika TOGASHI , Kochiyo 's brother and a former Shugo deported from Kaga , who belonged to East squad , and deported Kochiyo in 1474 . ( In other words , Ikko-Ikki in Kaga was started as a power struggle inside Shinshu ) </s>
<s> However , Hongan-ji 's Monto and Masachika TOGASHI opposed each other after that , and when Masachika sent a force to subdue Ikko Shu in 1488 , they forced Masachika to commit suicide by his sword , and achieved autonomous control ( However , Masataka TOGASHI of the Togashi clan showed sympathy for Ikko-Ikki , and he remained Shugo Daimyo symbolically ) . </s>
<s> After that , the Monto aimed to recapture the meeting house ( Dojo ) in Yoshizaki of which the Asakura clan had deprived , and Monto mustered from all over Hokuriku area fought against the Asakura clan more than once . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , in Kinai , the headquarters were Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple , which Rennyo , moving from Yoshizaki , had built in Kyoto in 1482 , and Harumoto HOSOKAWA , being afraid of its influence , set fire to Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple in August in 1532 in conspiracy with Nichiren Shu followers ( Shinshu calls this " Tenbun no Sakuran , " and Nichiren Shu " tenbun Hokke no Ran " ) . </s>
<s> Hongan-ji Temple lost their headquarters by this incident , and moved it to a temple in Ishiyama in Osaka , which Rennyo had built in his final years ( 1496 ) , and lived in ( Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple ) . </s>
<s> Since then , Osaka developed around the monastery of Hongan-ji Temple , comparable to a castle , and a temple town formed around it , and it strength frightened power people of the time . </s>
<s> In 1568 , when Nobunaga ODA conquered Kinai and came into conflict with Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA who became the Seii Taishogun , Kennyo ( 1543-1592 ) , the 11th head-priest of Hongan-ji Temple , took the side of Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA , and on September 12 , 1570 , suddenly attacked the camp of Nobunaga , who was attacking the Miyoshi clan . </s>
<s> Responding to this , Monto rose in revolt around the nation , and the uprising by Gansho-ji Temple in Nagashima in Ise Province ( Nagashima Ikko-Ikki ) brought down Kokie Castle in Owari Province . </s>
<s> Although Kennyo and Nobunaga concluded agreements a few times after that , Kennyo , upon request from Yoshiaki and others , violated the agreements several times , which caused most Ikko-Ikki other than Ishiyama , such as Nagashima or Echizen , to be ended by mass executions by Nobunaga . </s>
<s> In 1580 , after they had fought for as long as 10 years in Ishiyama since the war broke out , Nobunaga accepted the agreement proposed by Emperor Ogimachi , and disarmament of Hongan-ji Temple and Kennyo 's departure from Ishiyama brought the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War to an end . </s>
<s> ( Later , Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI constructed Osaka Castle in the area including the site of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple . ) </s>
<s> As described above , Ikko-Ikki was one of the biggest forces in Japanese society at the time and ranked with Sengoku Daimyo ( warlords ) , but all the Monto of Shinshu did not go along with this movement . </s>
<s> As seen in the case of the battle between Hongan-ji Monto and Senshu-ji School Monto ( Takada Monto and Shinshu Sanmonto School ) in Echizen Province , some Shinshu sects other than Hongan-ji had a conflicting movement . </s>
<s> Reconstruction in Kyoto </s>
<s> In the days of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI , in 1591 , Kennyo was given land in the center of Kyoto ( Shichijo-Horikawa , Kyoto City ) and reconstructed Hongan-ji Temple . </s>
<s> In 1602 , mainly due to the confrontation in the sect over the difference of views when leaving Ishiyama , and the influence of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA 's policy on religion , Kyonyo ( 1558-161 ) , Kennyo 's oldest son , was given the nearby land to the east of Hongan-ji Temple ( Shichijo-Karasuma , Kyoto City ) by Ieyasu , and built Higashi Hongan-ji Temple . </s>
<s> By this incident , Hongan-ji Temple , which had the biggest religious influence at the time , was split into West ( current Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji School , Shinshu Kosho School , etc . ) with Junnyo ( 1577-1630 ) , Kennyo 's third son , as the 12th head-priest , and East ( current Shinshu Otani School , etc . ) with Kyonyo , the oldest son , as the 12th head-priest . </s>
<s> When religions were restructured after the Meiji Restoration , and on the occasion of official registration as a religious association to Daikyoin , only the current Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji School applied as Jodo Shinshu and others as Shinshu , which has affected the current names . </s>
<s> Furthermore , there exists a new religion related to Jodo Shinshu , which is connected to folk beliefs over a long period of history . </s>
<s> Currently , it is made up of 10 schools affiliated to Jodo Shinshu sects and other schools , and as a whole sect , it has the most temples ( about 22,000 temples ) and followers among Japanese Buddhist sects . </s>

<s> The Four Gods in this case are as follows : the mountains in the back are Genbu ( black warrior ) ; Sui in front is Suzaku ( a red phoenix ) ; the left Sa with Genbu in the background is Seiryu ( a blue dragon ) and the right Sa is Byakko ( a white tiger ) . </s>
<s> In Kyoto , Japan it was possible to have the following association : the Tanzawa Mountains in the north as Genbu , Mt . Hidari-Daimonji as Seiryusa , Arashiyama in the west as Byakkosa and Ogura-ike Pond in the south as Suzaku ; therefore , Kyoto was a land of Shijin-so-o topography exactly from the perspective of the feng shui standard . </s>
<s> However , Ogura-ike Pond was completely consumed by landfills , which broke the Shijin-so-o topography of Kyoto . </s>
<s> Mt . Funaoka , which once overlooked Suzaku-oji Avenue , is a little too small for Genbu . </s>
<s> In the standard viewpoint of feng shui , Mt . Funaoka is interpreted as Seiho , to which Sanryu , a dragon of mountains , is headed via Genbu . </s>
<s> Japan </s>
<s> In modern Japan , the interpretation that the Four Gods are related to ' mountain , river , road and lake , ' as shown in the following table , is generally accepted . </s>
<s> However , this association has not necessarily been settled since ancient times . </s>
<s> The " Sakuteiki Gardening Book " is source of the theory that equates the Four Gods to ' mountain , river , road and lake . ' </s>
<s> " Sakuteiki Gardening Book " explains how to create a garden , taking Shinden-zukuri ( a style of architecture for the residence of court nobles ) into consideration , in which the theory of ' Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake ' is described as the ideal basis for such a garden . </s>
<s> It also explains that planting certain kinds of trees can substitute ' The Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake ' in the event there is no mountain , river , road and lake to represent the Four Gods . </s>
<s> The interpretation that the Four Gods are related to ' mountain , river , road and lake ' has been generally accepted in modern Japan , since the association of Seiryu = Kamo-gawa River ( the Yodo-gawa River system ) , Byakko = Sanin-do Road , Suzaku = Ogura-ike Pond and Genbu = Mt . Funaoka was relatively successful with Heian-kyo as a model . </s>
<s> In fact , " Sakuteiki Gardening Book " mentions nothing about Heian-kyo , much less the specific places of the mountain , river , road and lake . </s>
<s> It is said that " Sakuteiki Gardening Book " was created at the end of the Heian period , judging by its content , which is why the theory of ' Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake ' can only date back to the end of the Heian period . </s>
<s> Therefore , we need to pay attention to the fact that there is no proof of the argument based on the assumption that this theory is the ideological background for choosing the land for Heian-kyo , which was built in the late eighth century . </s>
<s> Moreover , the association of mountain , river , road and lake , as allegedly done well into the Heian-kyo , has been claimed since the Edo period , which became the general interpretation later in the Meiji period . </s>
<s> In fact , even though a city prior to the Edo period would have been designed to match the Shijin-so-o topography , it is very unlikely that the Four Gods were Mountain , River , Road and Lake . </s>
<s> For example , in the imperial rescript , when building the capital , Heijo-kyo is described as follows : </s>
<s> Right now , the place of Heijo is in accordance with the painting of four beasts ; three mountains assuage things , and turtle augury tells the same . ' </s>
<s> The phrase ' accordance with the painting of four beasts ' here means Shijin-so-o topography , which confirms that during the Nara period Heijo-kyo was considered to be the place having Shijin-so-o topography . </s>
<s> The location of Heijo-kyo doesn 't apply to a mountain , river , road and lake as described for Heian-kyo . </s>
<s> However , as long as it is associated with Shijin-so-o topography it is likely that another interpretation would have been accepted during the Nara period . </s>
<s> Shirin Saiyo-sho commentary in the late Kamakura period mentions that ' the central mountains are related to Genbu , and the people , panoply and oven are related to Suzaku ... , ' which shows that Suzaku was associated with ' people , panoply and oven . ' </s>
<s> Moreover , " Ryueihikan " mentions that ' Winds of the Edo Castle merit the position of the world 's castle , and its land coincides with Shijin-so-o topography ' . </s>
<s> The author of " Ryueihikan " , Yamon KIKUCHI , considered that Edo Castle was built on the land coinciding with Shijin-so-o topography . </s>
<s> But if applying the theory that ' Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake ' , then Tokyo Bay , which is likely to be Suzaku ( god said to rule over the southern heavens ) , spreads from east to south-by-southeast , and Koshu-kaido Road , which is likely to be Byakko ( god said to rule over the western heavens ) , only stretches to the west no matter how you see them in their favor . " </s>
<s> It is far-fetched to say that such geography matches the theory of ' Four Gods = Mountain , river , road and lake . ' </s>
<s> Furthermore , the interpretation that Himeji Castle , Fukuyama Castle ( Bingo-no-kuni ) or Kumamoto Castle matches the Shijin-so-o topography of ' Mountain , river , road and lake ' theory emerged later . </s>
<s> As for Nagoya Castle , " Kinjo-onko-roku records " mentions that ' Your great castle has roads open to four directions , and people gather from all over the world ; like the world 's castle , it places chokepoints at about 40 kilometers ; it has mountains in the east , the sea in the south , Kiso-gawa River in the northwest , and in between it installs strategic stops at a distance of about 140 kilometers ( omission ) ; lying ahead , a fort on Mt . Yagoto in the east , Saya and the armed camp in Kiyosu in the west ( omission ) ; with the castle , camps and walls , these indicate the key castle of Shijin-so-o topography . ' </s>
<s> The Shijin-so-o topography described in " Kinjo-onko-roku records " is not ' mountain , river , road and lake , ' either . </s>
<s> There is no concept of certain fortune on a certain direction in the feng shui of ancient China , so it is an original Japanese concept to abhor Kimon ( the direction of northeast , called an ogre gate ) and Urakimon ( the direction of southwest which is the opposite side of Kimon ) . </s>
<s> In this sense , one must doubt the theory expressed in " Kamadoyama Kyuki histroy book " that Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine was made based on feng shui according to the description that Kamado-jinja Shrine was made to protect Kimon of Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine at the time of its construction . </s>
<s> This is how the interpretation of Shijin-so-o topography has changed from ancient times to the early modern times , and it is believed to be unique and different from the feng shui of ancient China . </s>

<s> Then , Irie Tosanokami guard ( Nobusada ) ' s son Masatoshi served the Shibata clan in Echizen-no-kuni , called himself the Wakasamori guard ; he was stationed in Echizen-Maruoka-jo Castle but died in Hokujo-jo Castle together with Katsuie SHIBATA . </s>
<s> Masatoshi 's son Nagamichi was employed by Hideyasu YUKI , who was a son of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and was adopted as a son-in-law by the Yuki Family , thus ending the history of the Sumitomo as a Samurai family . </s>

<s> Masatomo , who was considered the omniscient successor of the Nehan-shu sect , returned to secular life after the Nehan-shu sect was absorbed into the Tendai-shu sect during the Kanei era and opened " Fujiya , " a business dealing with books and pharmaceuticals in Rakuchu ( called himself Kakyu ) , and started a hardworking life . </s>

<s> Nanban-fuki , a method of refining copper </s>
<s> The Sumitomo Family is closely connected with copper refining , which began in the year 19 of Tensho when Riemon learned the refining method used to separate silver from crude copper , which was called the " Nanban-fuki copper refining method " by Hakusui of Minjin ( from Min ) , who had come to Senshu-Sakaiura . </s>
<s> At that time it wasn 't known in Japan that gold , silver and the like were contained in crude copper , nor was the refining technique for separating gold and silver known . </s>
<s> Riemon learned from Hakusui of Minjin the refining method and kept it secret , and thanks to the Nanban-fuki copper refining method the Sumitomo Family gained enormous profit by extracting silver from crude copper . </s>

<s> Additionally , although Kanichi and Moto , who were brothers of the sixteenth-generation Kichizaemon Tomonari , were stockholders of the Sumitomo main company , they were never named as executives of the main company or any of its subsidiary companies . </s>
<s> In this respect the Sumitomo Family can be said to be in contrast with the Mitsui and Iwasaki families . </s>
<s> This tendency has in fact existed since the Edo period ( there were many cases where family heads were not engaged in management because they were in infancy or in poor health , or for other reasons , and consequently the so-called " ohbanto " would control the business ) . </s>

<s> As symbolized by the fact that Kichizaemon was called " Kacho-sama , " extremely high respect was accorded to the Kichizaemon , from the high-ranking position of head of the directors down to the rank and file , and the successive Kichizaemon elevated the Sumitomo name through the cultural enterprise on one hand while on the other hand trying to raise the corporate morale as the family head and president of the Zaibatsu main company . </s>

<s> At that time the sorinin of the Sumitomo Family , Saihei HIROSE , and the manager of the Osaka main office , Teigo IBA , decided that Tomochika 's wife Toku would succeed to the name of the fourteenth-generation Kichizaemon on one hand and that Takamaro TOKUDAIJI , from the Seiga Family , would be adopted as son-in-law to marry Tomotada 's younger sister Masu , whereby the bloodline of the Sumitomo Family could be successfully maintained . </s>

<s> Amanohashidate has shrunk in recent years due to erosion , and is in danger of disappearing . </s>
<s> This is because dams were built on the rivers after the war , reducing the amount of sediment carried from the mountains to the sea , and destroying the balance of sediment deposits and erosion on Amanohashidate . </s>
<s> To prevent further erosion , the administration has installed many small erosion barriers on the sand bar in an attempt to stop the sand from washing away ( in the picture from the south ( Hiryukan ) , it is the part on the right where the beach is serrated ) . </s>

<s> Muromachi Bakufu was a samurai government established by Takauji ASHIKAGA . </s>
<s> It was Japan 's second Bakufu government , following the Kamakura Bakufu . </s>
<s> The name ' Muromachi ' was derived from the Muromachi-dono , which was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA , the third Ashikaga Shogun , to serve as the public residence of the Shogun ( commonly known as Hana no Gosho , this residence is located in what is now Kamigyo Ward , Kyoto City ) . </s>
<s> There are two views regarding the year of Muromachi Bakufu 's establishment--in November 1336 , when the administrative policies of Bakufu were set up ( being clearly indicated as Kenmu Shikimoku ) , or in 1338 , when Takauji ASHIKAGA was assigned as Seii Taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) by Emperor Komyo of Jimyoin-to faction ( 持明院統 ) ; however , the former view is more convincing . </s>
<s> Regarding the time when the bakufu ended , it virtually ended in 1573 when the fifteenth shogun , Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA , was banished from Kyoto by Nobunaga ODA . </s>
<s> The period of slightly more than 240 years between the beginning and the end is called the Muromachi period . </s>
<s> Furthermore , the period until the unification of Hokucho and Nancho is called the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , and the period after the Onin War ( 1467 ) or the Meio Incident ( 1493 ) is called the Age of Civil War ( Japan ) . </s>
<s> Because procedures for the removal of Seii Taishogun were not implemented even after Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA 's banishment from Kyoto , he was still treated as a shogun by the powers opposed to Nobunaga . </s>
<s> " Kugyo-Bunin " treated Yoshiaki as a Shogun until February 9 1588 , when he followed Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI , chief adviser to the Emperor , and visited the Imperial Palace , vowed loyalty to Hideyoshi and was granted status as Ju-sangu . </s>
<s> Also , according to the official opinion of the government at the time , from the end of the Meiji period until defeat in World War II , Nancho ( Japan ) was regarded as the legitimate imperial line , and this age was referred to as the ' period of the Northern and Southern Courts ( Japan ) ' ; because of such a view , the first shogun Takauji , the second shogun Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA and the third shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA were not acknowledged as official shoguns ( based on imperial history ) . </s>
<s> The staff organization of Muromachi Bakufu is more or less adapted from the organization of Kamakura Bakufu . </s>
<s> As for law , Takauji enacted Kenmu Shikimoku as a basic law ( in 1336 ) . </s>
<s> As a detailed law , Goseibai-shikimoku ( Joe-shikimoku ) of the Kamakura period was applied , and when necessary an additional law called ' Kenmu-irai-tsuika ' was issued to supplement the above . </s>
<s> Government during the initial period was unstable , partly because Nancho still existed . </s>
<s> Also , a government structure was assigned with the shogun at the top , along with Samurai-dokoro , government office , monchu-jo , hyojo-shu , hikitsuke-shu as the control with the role of supporting the shogun . </s>
<s> Muromachi Bakufu was a united government of Shugo daimyos , and the control originating from the chamberlain position of the Ashikaga clan did not have the actual power that the regents of Kamakura Bakufu had ; consequently , government by bakufu was in principle conducted through a council system . </s>
<s> The major Shugo daimyos referred to as Sankan--the Hosokawa clan , Shiba clan and Hatakeyama clan--assumed the position of control and supported the Shogun , while the Akamatsu clan , Isshiki clan , Yamana clan and Kyogoku clan , as Shishiki , assumed by turns the position of Shoshi , the chief of Samurai-dokoro . </s>
<s> Major posts of the bakufu and shugos governing several lands were held by the Ashikaga family such as the Hosokawa clan , Shiba clan , Yamana clan , Isshiki clan , Hatakeyama clan , Shibukawa clan , Imagawa clan , Uesugi clan ( cognate ) , etc . </s>
<s> Also , Hoko-shu was formed as the military power directly under the control of the shogun . </s>
<s> Successive Shoguns : A List of Ashikaga Shoguns </s>
<s> The collapse of the public ownership system of manors = transfer to the system of ownership by Shugo daimyos and the development of a monetary economy are part of the characteristics of Muromachi Bakufu . </s>
<s> In the Kamakura period , individual Gokenin directly paid homage to the Shogun ( although there were exceptions such as being hired by a strong Gokenin ) , and shugos were mere supervisors of Gokenin within their lands . </s>
<s> However , during the Muromachi period the Shugo daimyos directly hired samurais in their lands , who became their vassals , and exercised unified control over their lands ( since there are exceptions or differences by region , please refer to the item ' System of Ownership by Shugo Daimyos ' for details ) . </s>
<s> Subsequently , even Shugo daimyos with power exceeding that of Shogun Muromachi were born . </s>
<s> Against such circumstances , Shogun Muromachi hired samurais of various regions over the Shugo daimyos ' heads , and formed ' Hoko-shu ' as mentioned above , which not only strengthened the direct military power of the shogun but also deterred the control of Shugo daimyos over their lands . </s>
<s> However , while there were cases in which the bakufu subdued individual Shugo daimyos , there was no case where a Shugo daimyo and Shogun Muromachi were fully in conflict with each other . </s>
<s> The Shugo daimyos proceeded to exercise control over their lands by the authority that they were assigned to the position of Shugo by Bakufu . </s>
